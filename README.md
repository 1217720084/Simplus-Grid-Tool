This is an old version of the toolbox, for getting the simulation results of a 14-bus inverter-based power system.

The version of the Matlab used is 2020b.

Please add "Library" folder into the Matlab searching path first. Then, run "UserMain.m" for getting the theoratical analysis, and run "Simulation_Duality_14Bus_GFM.slx" for getting the simulation results. Plotting functions and data are saved in "Plot" folder.
