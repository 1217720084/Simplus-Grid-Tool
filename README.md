# Power System Analysis Toolbox

This is an old version of toolbox for getting the simulation results of a 14-bus inverter-based power system in our publication. The up-to-date version of the toolbox is available at the master branch [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool). For using this old version, please use Matlab 2020b, add "Library" folder into the Matlab searching path first, and then run "UserMain.m" for getting the theoratical analysis, and finally run "Simulation_Duality_14Bus_GFM.slx" for getting the simulation results. "Duality_14Bus.xlsx" contains the system paramters.
