# Power System Analysis Toolbox

This is an old version of toolbox for getting the simulation results of a 14-bus inverter-based power system in our publication. For using the latest version of the toolbox, please click [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool). For using this old version, please use Matlab 2020b, add "Library" folder into the Matlab searching path first, and then run "UserMain.m" for getting the theoratical analysis, and run "Simulation_Duality_14Bus_GFM.slx" for getting the simulation results. "Duality_14Bus.xlsx" contains the system paramters.
