# Power-System-Analysis-Toolbox (Version: v2020-OCT-22)

This is an old version of the toolbox to illustrate the results of the port-mapping article. These codes are specially customized for the case study in the article, so do NOT create your own case upon these codes as they may generate unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please use the up-to-date version in the master branch [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

# Notes
