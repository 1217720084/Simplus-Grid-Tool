# Power System Analysis Toolbox

This is an old version of toolbox for getting the simulation results in our publication. These codes are specially customized for the case study in the article, so do NOT create your own case upon these codes as they may generate unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please use the up-to-date version in the master branch [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

# Notes

For using this old version, please use Matlab 2020b, add "Library" folder into the Matlab searching path first, and then run "UserMain.m" for getting the theoratical analysis, and finally run "Simulation_Duality_14Bus_GFM.slx" for getting the simulation results. "Duality_14Bus.xlsx" contains the system paramters.
