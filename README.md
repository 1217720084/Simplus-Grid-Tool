## Quick Start

Download all codes, and run "CustormerMain.m" by using Matlab 2020b.

## Quick Help

If the old version of Matlab is used, please convert "Simplex_PowerSystems_2016a.slx" to the required version, and make it cover "Simplex_PowerSystems.slx". This file contains the Simulink blocks used in this toolbox. The Matlab version eailier than 2016a is not supported currently.

For setting custormer data, please use "CustormerData.xlsx". It defaultly contains the data of a 4-bus generator-inverter-composite power system example.
