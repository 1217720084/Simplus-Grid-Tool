## Introduction

This project contains materials for getting the simulation results in our publication "Rethinking Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters: A Duality Theory". These codes are specially customized for the case study in the article, so do NOT create your own case upon these codes as they may generate unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please use the up-to-date version in the master branch [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

## Notes for Single-Inverter-Infinite-Bus System

Models and scripts are saved in folders "SingleInverterCase_Simulation" and "SingleInverterCase_Script".

## Notes for 14-Bus System

The results are generated by an old version of our toolbox. For using this old toolbox, please use Matlab 2020b, add "Library" folder into the Matlab searching path first, and then run "UserMain.m" for getting the theoratical analysis, and finally run "Simulation_Duality_14Bus_GFM.slx" for getting the simulation results. "Duality_14Bus.xlsx" contains the system paramters.
